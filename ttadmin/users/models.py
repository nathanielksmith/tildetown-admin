# development notes!

# what the puppet module does:
# * creates user account
# * creates home directory
# * creates authorized_keys2
# * adds user to group 'tilde' (why?)
# * sets shell
# * creates .ssh directory
# * creates .irssi directory
# * creates templatized .irssi config file (irssi isn't even default anymore...)
# * creates hardcoded .twurlrc file (why not skel?)
#
# some of this stuff is pointless and the actually required stuff is:
# * create user account (useradd)
# * create home dir (useradd)
# * create .ssh/authorized_keys2 (need functions for this
# * set shell (chsh)
# * create .twurlrc (just use /etc/skel)

# other things to consider:
# * what happens when a user wants their name changed?
#  * it looks like usermod -l and a mv of the home dir can change a user's username.
#  * would hook this into the pre_save signal to note a username change
# * what happens when a user is marked as not reviewed?
#  * does this signal user deletion? Or does literal Townie deletion signal
#    "needs to be removed from disk"? I think it makes the most sense for the
#    latter to imply full user deletion.
#  * I honestly can't even think of a reason to revert a user to "not reviewed"
#    and perhaps it's best to just not make that possible. for now, though, I
#    think I can ignore it.
# * what happens when a user needs to be banned?
#  * the Townie should be deleted via post_delete signal
# * what are things about a user that might change in django and require changes on disk?
#  * username
#  * displayname (only if i start using this?)
#  * ssh key
#
# how should this code be structured?
# * within the Townie model, hardcoded
# * outside the Townie model, procedurally
# * within an abstract class
#
# for now my gut says to implement stuff hardcoded in the Townie class but with
# an eye towards generalizing the pattern in some base class for other
# resources as needed.
